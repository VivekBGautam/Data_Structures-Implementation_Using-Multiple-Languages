# Singly_Linear_Linked_List (C)

This repository contains a **Singly Linear Linked List** implementation in **C language**. It is designed for learning and practicing **Data Structures** concepts such as dynamic memory allocation, pointers, and linked list operations.

A singly linked list is a collection of nodes where:

* Each node stores **data**
* Each node contains a pointer to the **next node**
* The last node points to **NULL**

---

##  Data Structure Used

```c
struct node
{
    int data;
    struct node *next;
};
```

---

##  Operations Implemented

* Insert node at first position
* Insert node at last position
* Insert node at given position
* Delete node from first position
* Delete node from last position
* Delete node from given position
* Display all elements
* Count number of nodes
* Search element (First / Last Occurrence)

---

##  How to Compile and Run

```
gcc Filename.c -o Myexe
./Myexe
```

---

##  Concepts Covered

* Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`)
* Pointers and structures
* Call by address
* Linear data structures
